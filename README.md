## Welcome

Thanks for taking the time to read about the prototype work
developed by myself. 

> TLDR just a small project creating value adding a way to charge system
using exterior panelling and micro connectors, node module interface
software update for software service patch route connect :select: mode
> TLDR a smaller module for learning some skill or trick inside a computer.

## Ad Mesh Innovations

**Ad mesh** innovations are **methods** of **application** 
associated with **but not limited too** application
of **fabric** and **material** sticky **patch** for **solair** 
**heat collection**.

**Light/Heat** induction **technology** for **heat/transfer**
to **direct** **energy|converter**.

**Solair-generation(reserved)**

Takes **direct energy** from **sun light** and converts
the **direct energy** from **the** sun **light** into the **system**
which in turn **returns** **power generation** stationary.

> i.e. "**solair Converter Modular**"

## Research Development

The following research has been conducted:

- sticky pads[pads]
- sticky resin[resinput]
- sticky applicators[applicator]
- sticky epoxy[eply]

### types of patches

- Matrix fabrics(pattern mods)
- Different solid patterns(solid mods)
- proto::typer.pl( perl file for decoding new DATA.)
- Compiler type readonly -> "Perl".
